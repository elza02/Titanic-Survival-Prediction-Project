The Titanic Survival Prediction project aims to develop a model that 
predicts whether a passenger on the Titanic would survive or not, based on various 
features such as age, gender, ticket class.
For this project, I used logistic regression, a statistical method 
for analyzing a dataset in which there are one or more independent variables that determine an outcome.
